## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+** (recommended: Python 3.9 or 3.10)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

**Note**: No external API keys are required. All processing is done locally using trained neural network models.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinukaveesha/neural-network-based-hate-content-analyzer.git
cd neural-network-based-hate-content-analyzer
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment is **highly recommended** to avoid package conflicts:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Requirements
Install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Download NLTK Data
The application will automatically download required NLTK data on first run, but you can also download it manually:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```


This will verify that all model files are correctly loaded and ready for use.

## Usage

### Running the Application

## Model Architecture

### Dual-Model System

#### 1. LSTM Neural Network (Primary Detection)
- **Purpose**: Binary hate speech detection (hate vs. non-hate)
- **Architecture**: Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanisms
- **Input**: Preprocessed text sequences (NLTK-based preprocessing)
- **Output**: Binary classification with probability score
- **File**: `models/best_lstm_model.h5` (12.6MB)
- **Vocabulary**: 17,079 unique tokens

#### 2. CNN Neural Network (Category Classification)  
- **Purpose**: Classify detected hate speech into specific categories
- **Architecture**: Multi-layer CNN with BatchNormalization and GlobalMaxPool1D
- **Input**: Simple preprocessed text (regex-based preprocessing)
- **Output**: 5-category classification with probability distribution
- **File**: `categorizing models/best_hate_classifier_cnn.h5` (12.6MB)
- **Vocabulary**: 18,080 unique tokens

### Category Classification System

The CNN model classifies hate speech into **5 distinct categories**:

1. **ðŸ”´ Gender-based Hate** (`sex_hate`)
   - Sexual harassment, gender discrimination
   
2. **ðŸŸ  General Hate Speech** (`other_hate`)  
   - General offensive content, personal attacks
   
3. **ðŸŸ¡ Sports-related Hate** (`sports_hate`)
   - Sports fan rivalry, team-based hatred
   
4. **ðŸŸ¢ Political Hate** (`politics_hate`)
   - Political party hatred, election-related toxicity
   
5. **ðŸ”µ Religious Hate** (`religious_hate`)
   - Religious discrimination, faith-based hatred
