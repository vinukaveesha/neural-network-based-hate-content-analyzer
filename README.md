## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.8+** (recommended: Python 3.9 or 3.10)
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (for category classification)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinukaveesha/neural-network-based-hate-content-analyzer.git
cd neural-network-based-hate-content-analyzer
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
Creating a virtual environment is **highly recommended** to avoid package conflicts:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Requirements
Install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Download NLTK Data
The application will automatically download required NLTK data on first run, but you can also download it manually:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
```

## Configuration

### Step 1: Get Google Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key for the next step

### Step 2: Create Environment File
Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env  # On Windows: type nul > .env
```

### Step 3: Add API Key to .env
Open the `.env` file and add your Gemini API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Important**: Never commit your API key to version control. The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore`.

## Usage

### Running the Application

#### Method 1: Direct Command
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

#### Method 2: Using the Launcher Script (Windows)
```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
run_app.bat
```

#### Method 3: Custom Port
```bash
# Run on a specific port
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Accessing the Application
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` (or the port shown in terminal)
3. Start analyzing text for hate speech!

### Using the Interface

#### Single Text Analysis
1. Select "Single Text" mode
2. Enter text in the input area
3. Click "Analyze Text"
4. View results including probability, confidence, and category

#### Batch Analysis
1. Select "Multiple Texts" mode
2. Enter multiple texts (one per line)
3. Click "Analyze All Texts"
4. View summary statistics and detailed results
5. Download results as CSV if needed

#### Settings
- **Detection Threshold**: Adjust sensitivity using the sidebar slider
- **Quick Examples**: Test with pre-built sample texts
- **Export Options**: Download batch results for further analysis

## Model Architecture

### LSTM Neural Network
- **Architecture**: Bidirectional LSTM with attention mechanisms
- **Input**: Preprocessed text sequences
- **Output**: Binary classification (hate speech vs. clean text)
- **Features**: 
  - Text preprocessing with NLTK
  - Tokenization and sequence padding
  - Confidence estimation based on prediction probability

### Text Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Emoji Removal**: Clean emojis using demoji library
2. **URL/Mention Cleaning**: Remove URLs, mentions, and hashtags
3. **Normalization**: Lowercase conversion and punctuation removal
4. **Tokenization**: Word-level tokenization
5. **Stopword Removal**: Remove common English stopwords
6. **Lemmatization**: Word lemmatization for better accuracy

### Training Details
- **Dataset**: Trained on curated hate speech datasets
- **Accuracy**: High precision and recall scores
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- **Regularization**: Dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting

## API Integration

### Google Gemini AI
- **Purpose**: Category classification of detected hate speech
- **Categories**:
  - Sexual harassment
  - Religious hate
  - Political hate
  - Racial discrimination
  - Gender-based hate
  - Other hate speech
- **Features**: Confidence scoring and explanation generation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Model Loading Error
```
Error: Cannot load model file
```
**Solution**: Ensure model files exist in the `models/` directory.

#### 2. NLTK Data Error
```
LookupError: Resource punkt not found
```
**Solution**: Run the NLTK download commands or restart the application.

#### 3. Gemini API Error
```
Error: API key not configured
```
**Solution**: Check your `.env` file and ensure the API key is correct.

#### 4. Virtual Environment Issues
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'streamlit'
```
**Solution**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and requirements are installed.
